Complex shape filled with particles. Returns an [`InitialCondition`](@ref).
Note that an initial particle grid is generated inside the bounding box of the shape.
An `point_in_shape_algorithm` checks if particles are inside the shape or not.
For more information about the method see [`WindingNumberJacobson`](@ref) or [`WindingNumberHorman`](@ref).

# Arguments
- `shape`: Complex shape returned by [`load_shape`](@ref).

# Keywords
- `particle_spacing`:   Spacing between the particles.
- `density`:            Either a function mapping each particle's coordinates to its density,
                        or a scalar for a constant density over all particles.
- `velocity`:           Either a function mapping each particle's coordinates to its velocity,
                        or, for a constant fluid velocity, a vector holding this velocity.
                        Velocity is constant zero by default.
- `mass`:               Either `nothing` (default) to automatically compute particle mass from particle
                        density and spacing, or a function mapping each particle's coordinates to its mass,
                        or a scalar for a constant mass over all particles.
- `pressure`:           Scalar to set the pressure of all particles to this value.
                        This is only used by the [`EntropicallyDampedSPHSystem`](@ref) and
                        will be overwritten when using an initial pressure function in the system.
                        Cannot be used together with hydrostatic pressure gradient.
- `point_in_shape_algorithm`: Algorithm for sampling the complex shape with particles.
                              It basically checks whether a particle is inside an object or not.
                              For more information see [`WindingNumberJacobson`](@ref) or [`WindingNumberHorman`](@ref)
- `seed`:               Coordinates of the minimum corner of the initial particle grid (excluding padding).
- `max_nparticles`:     Maximum number of particles in the initial particle grid.
- `pad_initial_particle_grid`: Padding of the initial particle grid.
